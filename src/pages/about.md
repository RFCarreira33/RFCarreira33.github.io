# About

## How I got into programming

In 2021 I decided to enroll on a **programming course** at IPLeiria with no prior coding experience because I wanted to perform a career change.

<br>

## Programming languages

I'm currently working with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [React](https://react.dev/) with **Typescript** but
I've worked with **PHP** and the [Yii2](https://www.yiiframework.com/) framework doing web development,
**C#** and [.Net](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) creating desktop apps and
**Java** building mobile apps for [Android](https://developer.android.com/).

<br>

## Hardware and stuff

I have a **desktop** with dual boot Windows and [Arch](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/btw-i-use-arch)
with a Ryzen 2700x, Nvidia 3060ti and 32gb of Ram
but my **daily driver** is a Macbook Air with the M1 processor and 16gb of Ram.

<br>

## Code editor

I use [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) but when it doesn't work like it should I go back to [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
with Vim keybinds. Both of them with the **OneDark** theme.
