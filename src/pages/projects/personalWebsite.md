## Description

This is my simple personal website made by someone with somewhat awful frontend skills, but it was on my ideas list so I had to it.

## What do you use it for

I use this website as a portfolio for my work, a personal page where share some more stuff about me and a way to improve my frontend skills without using the mainstream frameworks.

<br>

## Built with

- [Astro](https://astro.build/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

<br>

## Examples

If you are reading this chances are that you have already seen how my website looks but if you didn't take a look around or click squirtle.
