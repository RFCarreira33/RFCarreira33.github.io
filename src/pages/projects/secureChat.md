## What is Secure Chat

Secure Chat, as the name implies, is a multi client **chat** with **end to end encryption** that uses a communication protocol developed by ex-Students of IPLeiria called **ProtocolSI**, it was a project for the TS (Tópicos de Segurança) curricular unit which stands for **Security Topics** and it introduced us to basic security processes.

## What does it do

This app lets users communicate and send small files between them with **end to end encryption**, well almost because one of the requirements of the project was that the server should keep a log of the messages send, but anyway it was a really cool project that teached me a lot about **cybersecurity** and **encryption**.
