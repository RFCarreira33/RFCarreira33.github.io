## Description

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a series of small programming puzzles which happens every year in December, and I use it to learn new languages, data structures and algorithms. 

<br>

## Back Story

A friend of mine introduced me to it and I started doing it in 2022 to learn C++, and I've been going back to past years to do the puzzles when I feel like learning a new language. I've not yet completed all the puzzles for any year, but I'm working on it.
