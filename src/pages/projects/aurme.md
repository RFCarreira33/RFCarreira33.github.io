## Description

Aurme, is a [Arch User Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/) (**AUR**) package manager, that allows you to search, install and update **AUR** packages. Knowing that are other helpers that let you manage pacman and **AUR** packages we decided to make our own, that would just manage **AUR** ones, and it was another great way to use and learn more about Rust.
